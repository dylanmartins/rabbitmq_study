sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues

We're done. If you want to save logs to a file, just open a console and type:

python receive_logs.py > logs_from_rabbit.log
If you wish to see the logs on your screen, spawn a new terminal and run:

python receive_logs.py
And of course, to emit logs type:

python emit_log.py

rabbitmqctl list_bindings

if you want to save only 'warning' and 'error' (and not 'info') log messages to a file, just open a console and type:

python receive_logs_direct.py warning error > logs_from_rabbit.log
If you'd like to see all the log messages on your screen, open a new terminal and do:

python receive_logs_direct.py info warning error
# => [*] Waiting for logs. To exit press CTRL+C
And, for example, to emit an error log message just type:

python emit_log_direct.py error "Run. Run. Or it will explode."
# => [x] Sent 'error':'Run. Run. Or it will explode.'


-----------------------------------------------------
To receive all the logs run:
python receive_logs_topic.py "#"

To receive all logs from the facility "kern":
python receive_logs_topic.py "kern.*"

Or if you want to hear only about "critical" logs:
python receive_logs_topic.py "*.critical"

You can create multiple bindings:
python receive_logs_topic.py "kern.*" "*.critical"

And to emit a log with a routing key "kern.critical" type:

python emit_log_topic.py "kern.critical" "A critical kernel error"
