sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues

We're done. If you want to save logs to a file, just open a console and type:

python receive_logs.py > logs_from_rabbit.log
If you wish to see the logs on your screen, spawn a new terminal and run:

python receive_logs.py
And of course, to emit logs type:

python emit_log.py

rabbitmqctl list_bindings
